## Configuration & installation for new project

**iOS:**
* Add `react-native-ble-plx` to a project as a dependency in `package.json` file.
  For example `"react-native-ble-plx": "Polidea/react-native-ble-plx"` will install
  latest version from Polidea's Github repository.
* Make sure that you have [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) installed on your system.
* Execute `npm install` to fetch and install a library.
* Open iOS project located in `./ios` folder.
* Move `BleClient.xcodeproj` located in `.node_modules/react-native-ble-plx/ios`
  using drag & drop to `Libraries` folder in your project.
* In general settings of a project add `libBleClient.a` to Linked Frameworks and Libraries.
* In `Build Settings`/`Search Paths`/`Framework search paths` add recursive path: `$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native-ble-plx`.
* In `Build Settings`/`Search Paths`/`Header search paths` add recursive path: `$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native/React`.  
* In `Build Options`/`Embedded Content Contains Swift Code` set to `true`.
* In `Build Phases` click on top left button and add `New Run Script Phase`. 
  * Shell command: `/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks`
  * Input Files:
    * `$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native-ble-plx/ios/BleClientManager/Carthage/Build/iOS/BleClientManager.framework`
    * `$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native-ble-plx/ios/BleClientManager/Carthage/Build/iOS/RxSwift.framework`
    * `$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native-ble-plx/ios/BleClientManager/Carthage/Build/iOS/RxCocoa.framework`
    * `$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native-ble-plx/ios/BleClientManager/Carthage/Build/iOS/RxBluetoothKit.framework`
* Minimal supported version of iOS is 8.0

**Android**:
* Add `react-native-ble-plx` to a project as a dependency in `package.json` file.
  For example `"react-native-ble-plx": "Polidea/react-native-ble-plx"` will install
  latest version from Polidea's Github repository.
* Execute `npm install` to fetch and install a library.
* Open Android project located in `./android` folder.
* In `settings.gradle` add following lines:
```
include ':react-native-ble-plx'
project(':react-native-ble-plx').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-ble-plx/android')
```
* In `build.gradle` of `app` module add following dependency:
```
compile project(':react-native-ble-plx')
```
* In `MainApplication.getPackages` add BleModule package:
```
@Override
protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
  return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
    new MainReactPackage(),
    new BlePackage()
  );
}
```
* In `AndroidManifest.xml` add Bluetooth permission:
```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
```
* Minimal supported SDK version is 18.

## Installing and running example app
* Go to example project folder `cd examples/ReactBLEScanner`.
* Make sure that you have [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) installed on your system.
* Install required packages executing: `npm install`.
* **iOS**: Open Xcode example project in `./examples/ReactBLEScanner/ios/ReactBLEScanner.xcodeproj`.
* **Android**: Open Android example project in `./examples/ReactBLEScanner/android`.
* Build and run.

## Developing modules and example app

You can use included scripts to sync files between this repository root and `node_module/react-native-ble-plx` if want to work on local copy of library:
* `./install-ble-lib.sh` - move files from root to `node_module/react-native-ble-plx`.
* `./sync-ble-lib.sh` - move files from `node_module/react-native-ble-plx` to root.

Scripts are located in `./examples/ReactBLEScanner` folder.

**Warning**: This operation may delete files on destination directory.

### Additional configuration for iOS

**TODO**

## JavaScript API

First of all include `BleModule` in react native project:

```javascript
import { BleManager } from 'react-native-ble-plx';
```

`BleManager` should be initialized with `new` keyword and method `destroy()` should be called
on it's instance when we are done with it:

```javascript
const manager = new BleManager()
// Work with BLE manager
manager.destroy()
```

### Cancelling operations
 Few operations such as monitoring characteristic's value changes can be cancelled by a user.
 Basically every API entry which accepts `transactionId` allows to call `cancelTransaction` function.
 When cancelled operation is a promise or a callback which registers errors, `"Cancelled"`
 error will be emitted in that case.

#### `cancelTransaction(transactionId)`
Cancels specified transaction if in progress. Otherwise does nothing.

*Parameters*:
* `transactionId` - Unique ID of a transaction to cancel.

### UUIDs format

Currently React Native allows to transfer only basic types between React Native modules and JS.
Therefore user needs to pass UUIDs in a form of a string. To make behavior more platform
independent all UUIDs returned from API calls are lowercase and in full 128bit, like for example: 
`00002a00-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`. Only exception are device UUIDs which are MAC 
addresses on Android and UUIDs on iOS. There is also a convenience function `fullUUID` implemented
in a library which converts any 16bit or 128bit UUID string to above form. **However all function
arguments of API functions defined below can receive UUIDs in any valid string form**.

### Manager state

#### `async state` [for now iOS only]
Current state of a manager.

*Returns*: Current state of a manager as a string:
* `'Unknown'` - the current state of the manager is unknown; an update is imminent.
* `'Resetting'` - the connection with the system service was momentarily lost; an update is imminent.
* `'Unsupported'` - the platform does not support Bluetooth low energy.
* `'Unauthorized'` - the app is not authorized to use Bluetooth low energy.
* `'PoweredOff'` - Bluetooth is currently powered off.
* `'PoweredOn'` - Bluetooth is currently powered on and available to use.

---

#### `onStateChange(listener)` [for now iOS only]
Notifies about state changes of a manager.

*Parameters*:
* `listener(newState)` - callback which emits state changes of BLE Manager. Look above
  for possible values.

*Returns*: Subscription on which `remove()` function can be called to unsubscribe.

### Scanning devices

#### `startDeviceScan(uuids, options, listener)`
Starts device scanning. When previous scan is in progress it will be stopped before executing this command.

*Parameters*:
* `uuids` - array of strings containing UUIDs of services which we would like have in
  scanned devices. If `null` it will scan all available devices.
* `options` - object containing platform specific options, which can be enabled for
  scanning (can be `null`):

```javascript
{
    "allowDuplicates": bool, // iOS: Devices will be scanned more frequently if true, by default false
    "autoConnect": bool,     // Android: allows to connect to devices which are not in range.
}
```

* `listener(error, scannedDevice)` - function which will be called for every scanned device (devices
   may be scanned multiple times). It's first argument is potential error which is set to non
   `null` value when scanning failed. You have to start scanning process again if that happens.
   Second argument is a scanned `device` passed as an object with following fields:

```javascript
{
    "uuid": string,            // UUID of scanned device (for iOS it's local identifier)
    "name": ?string,           // device name if present or null otherwise
    "rssi": ?number,           // RSSI value during scanning

    "manufacturerData": ?string,                 // Manufacturer specific data
    "serviceData": ?{[service: string]: string}, // Data related to service
    "serviceUUIDs": ?string[],                   // UUIDs of advertised services
    "txPowerLevel": ?number,                     // Transmitted power level
    "solicitedServiceUUIDs": ?string[],          // Solicited service UUIDs

    "isConnectable": ?boolean,                   // Is device connectable (iOS only)
    "overflowServiceUUIDs": ?string[]            // Overflow service UUIDs (iOS only)

    // Utility functions
